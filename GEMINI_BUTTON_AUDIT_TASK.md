URGENT: COMPREHENSIVE UI BUTTON AUDIT & FIX - PUFFIN APPLICATION

TASK OBJECTIVE: Conduct complete audit of ALL buttons in Puffin UI and ensure 100% functionality - NO DEAD UI ELEMENTS ALLOWED

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Application: Puffin (AI Desktop Application)
- Framework: Electron + React + TypeScript
- UI Library: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Location: /Users/jibbr/Desktop/Wonder/Puffin/src/renderer/src/components/

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. COMPLETE BUTTON INVENTORY
   - Scan ALL .tsx/.ts files in components directory
   - Identify every <Button>, <button>, and clickable element
   - Document button location, purpose, and current state

2. CATEGORIZE ALL BUTTONS BY FUNCTION:
   - Navigation buttons (routing, tab switching)
   - Action buttons (save, delete, create, submit)
   - Toggle buttons (settings, modes, switches) 
   - Service control buttons (start/stop Ollama, ChromaDB)
   - Canvas mode buttons (tools, views, inspector)
   - Developer mode buttons (tabs, controls)
   - Modal/dialog buttons (confirm, cancel, close)
   - Form buttons (submit, reset, validate)
   - File management buttons (upload, download, browse)
   - Agent system buttons (create, edit, delete agents)

3. IDENTIFY & FIX DEAD/BROKEN BUTTONS:
   - Buttons with missing onClick handlers
   - Buttons calling undefined functions
   - Buttons with broken imports
   - Disabled buttons that should be enabled
   - Buttons with incorrect props or state
   - Placeholder buttons with no functionality

4. PRIORITY AREAS (SCAN THESE FIRST):
   - Canvas mode interface (/canvas/)
   - Developer mode tabs (/chat/DeveloperMode.tsx)
   - Service management (/layout/, /overlays/)
   - Chat interface (/chat/)
   - Settings and configuration (/modals/)
   - Agent system (/agents/)

5. IMPLEMENTATION FIXES:
   - Add missing onClick handlers
   - Implement proper event handling
   - Connect to backend services where needed
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Ensure proper visual feedback
   - Fix TypeScript type issues
   - Add accessibility attributes

6. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Every button must have functional purpose
   - All buttons must provide user feedback
   - No console errors when clicked
   - Proper state management
   - Consistent behavior patterns

SEARCH PATTERN REFERENCE:
I've identified 200+ button instances across these key files:
- AppLayout.tsx (18 buttons)
- CanvasView.tsx (7 buttons) 
- CodeCanvas.tsx (14 buttons)
- DeveloperMode.tsx (7 buttons)
- InputBar.tsx (15 buttons)
- AgentManagementPanel.tsx (6 buttons)
- ModelSelector.tsx (5 buttons)
- SettingsModal.tsx (3 buttons)

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:

1. COMPLETE AUDIT REPORT:
   - Total button count
   - Functional vs non-functional breakdown
   - Priority issues identified
   - File-by-file analysis

2. FIX IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Code changes for each broken button
   - New event handlers where needed
   - Backend service connections
   - State management improvements

3. VERIFICATION:
   - Test each fixed button
   - Confirm no regressions
   - Document remaining work needed

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Code organization suggestions
   - Future maintenance guidelines

START IMMEDIATELY - This is blocking Canvas mode functionality and overall user experience.

Focus on making every single button in the Puffin UI functional and providing proper user feedback.

NO PLACEHOLDER OR DUMMY BUTTONS ALLOWED.
